# Specification Quality Checklist: Adapt slog to OpenTelemetry

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-04-12
**Feature**: [spec.md](file:///Users/reidlai/GitLocal/resgate-listener/specs/102-slog-otel/spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- The specification correctly identifies the goal of observability correlation without prescribing exactly how to write the Go code, although it references the requested library for context.
- All success criteria are measurable.
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers were used as standard defaults for OTel and slog were applied.
